Cheat Sheet
========

Attention: If you're able to interact with the dropdown menus within the spreadsheet, you can skip reading past "general tips".

General tips
------

When you enter monetary values, please look at how they're presented in the spreadsheet. If you see the numbers seperated by a comma, use only commas to seperate them. If you see the numbers seperated by a dot, use only dots to seperate them. For example: If you see values like "1,093,049" on the spreadsheet, use commas when you enter monetary values. If you see values like "1.093.049", use dots only. I realize this is a stupid thing to ask, but there's nothing we can do, since it's one of the bugs of the Excel Web App.

The table at the bottom of the "Final" worksheet can be copied and pasted into a reddit comment to produce a table with your proposed team.

Each yellow cell next to a player in the workbook should be filled in with either an action or a dollar amount, depending on the section. The actions are specific to each section and must be typed exactly. They are not case sensitive but must not contain any missing or extra characters. For example, "Re-sign" and "re-sign" will both work but "Re Sign" and "resign" will not.

The available inputs for each section are listed below. For detailed descriptions of each action, see the "Instructions" sheet. If you have MS Excel, it is suggested that you download the speadsheet using the link within the embedded spreadsheet and use it offline as each cell will then be populated with dropdowns containing the acceptable values.

Instructions for Step1
------

First, enter the abbreviation of a team (BOS, BKN etc) in the yellow cell at the top of the ""Step1" sheet. This will populate your current team. Check this list if you need to find the abbreviation for a team.

New Orleans is "NOP" in this workbook because "Hornets" is a stupid team name.

**Current Roster**: "Waive", "Stretch", "Buyout", "Retire", "Trade", "Retain"

**2014 Draft**: "Sign", "Trade", "Release", "Overseas"

**Cap Holds**: "Re-sign", "Accept Player Option", "Signs Elsewhere", "Sign and Trade", "Sign Rookie", "Renounce", "Keep Rights"

**Player Options**: "Opt-out", "Waive", "Stretch", "Buyout", "Retire", "Trade", "Retain"

**Amnesty Candidates**: "Y", "N"

**Player (Trade or Disabled) Exceptions**: "Retain", "Expire", "Renounce", "Use"

Instructions for Step2
--------

Make sure you type monetary values correctly. Read the "General Tips" section if you don't know what I'm talking about.

Instructions for Step3
--------

**Sign Free Agents with Exceptions**: "Keep", "Renounce"

**Use cap exceptions with**: "Keep", "Renounce"

Add "Dead Money" players like completed 10-day contracts during the season

Same stuff applies with monetary values.

Instructions for Final
------------

Nothing to do here. If you've done everything correctly, you should get the results of your inputs. If you have further questions, read the "Instructions" tab which can be found in the sheet.
